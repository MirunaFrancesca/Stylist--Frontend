Ｓｔｙｌｉｓｔ

Fashion is a world of art and free expression which means that all humans are included and can find a way to match their style with their personalities. 

Stylist is a hybrid mobile application that offers the possibility of being used from the smaller screens of mobile devices to the bigger screens of PCs or tablets. 
Its purpose is fed by the everyday necessity of wearing various clothes and thus, aims to deliver a solution by generating outfits from the personal wardrobe of each user.

It is intended to maximize the possibilities of matching the garments by relying on an algorithm founded upon color theories, which gives balance and cohesion to each 
outfit. Different colour harmonies have been taken into consideration such as the complementary and the monochromatic one, which are used on a daily basis by proffesionals
to enhance and up their game in photography, home decor, fashion, product design, marketing, movies, painting and many more. 

Each user can find in Stylist both a virtual wardrobe and a virtual "stylist" for matching their clothes into fashionable outfits.

Prior to using the application, each user has to login or create account.

Users can keep track of their ever-growing clothing attire by uploading photos of their clothes and enjoy their integrations into outfits generated through the application. They can also save their favourite oufits from the app so they can come back to them later.
